1
00:00:00,09 --> 00:00:04,05
This course is intended to deepen your understanding

2
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:08,03
of both the waterfall and agile project frameworks.

3
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:12,00
There are many specific ways to implement each one of them.

4
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:15,03
Your situation and organization will be unique,

5
00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:18,08
and this course takes a very tactical approach

6
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:23,02
in how and when each methodology can be applied.

7
00:00:23,02 --> 00:00:26,04
If you're new to agile, I recommend taking my course

8
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:29,09
on Transitioning from Waterfall to Agile Project Management

9
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:32,04
or the Agile at Work series.

10
00:00:32,04 --> 00:00:35,09
This will help you understand the agile mindset more deeply

11
00:00:35,09 --> 00:00:39,03
before this course dives into the tactics.

12
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:42,02
If you understand agile, but are less comfortable

13
00:00:42,02 --> 00:00:45,05
in the traditional or waterfall project methods,

14
00:00:45,05 --> 00:00:47,01
I recommend taking the course

15
00:00:47,01 --> 00:00:49,04
Project Management Foundations.

16
00:00:49,04 --> 00:00:50,07
This course will ground you

17
00:00:50,07 --> 00:00:53,08
in the basics of this methodology.

18
00:00:53,08 --> 00:00:55,08
Each of these frameworks has their own

19
00:00:55,08 --> 00:00:58,03
unique strengths and weaknesses.

20
00:00:58,03 --> 00:01:01,09
We'll be probing these aspects so you can choose which path

21
00:01:01,09 --> 00:01:04,07
to follow with full awareness.

22
00:01:04,07 --> 00:01:08,05
All projects measure success by the value they deliver

23
00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:10,02
to their stakeholders.

24
00:01:10,02 --> 00:01:13,02
Additionally, organizations measure success

25
00:01:13,02 --> 00:01:15,03
through the amount of time they take,

26
00:01:15,03 --> 00:01:19,05
the costs they require, and the features they complete.

27
00:01:19,05 --> 00:01:21,05
We'll explore how each framework

28
00:01:21,05 --> 00:01:24,08
approaches these success measurements differently.

29
00:01:24,08 --> 00:01:28,06
Finally, we'll examine how each methodology measures

30
00:01:28,06 --> 00:01:33,04
and reports its ongoing progress and status to stakeholders.

31
00:01:33,04 --> 00:01:36,06
Utilizing the right key performance indicators

32
00:01:36,06 --> 00:01:40,06
will help you and your team remain on track.

33
00:01:40,06 --> 00:01:44,01
If you're ready for a deep tactical examination

34
00:01:44,01 --> 00:01:48,02
of agile and waterfall, this is the course for you.
