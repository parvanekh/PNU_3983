1
00:00:00,08 --> 00:00:04,02
So let's talk about traditional project management.

2
00:00:04,02 --> 00:00:06,09
It's really been around for over 50 years,

3
00:00:06,09 --> 00:00:11,03
and most of the time we call this methodology waterfall.

4
00:00:11,03 --> 00:00:12,01
Why?

5
00:00:12,01 --> 00:00:15,09
Well, each step, or phase, must be completed

6
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:18,03
before the next one can start.

7
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:21,01
So the visualization of this is really

8
00:00:21,01 --> 00:00:24,01
like the structure of a waterfall.

9
00:00:24,01 --> 00:00:25,08
It's a defined process.

10
00:00:25,08 --> 00:00:30,02
And all that means is that each step is laid out in advance.

11
00:00:30,02 --> 00:00:33,03
It originated with manufacturing and construction,

12
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:37,02
because in those fields, each step has to happen

13
00:00:37,02 --> 00:00:40,04
and complete before the next one can actually start.

14
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:43,08
It was then translated into software development.

15
00:00:43,08 --> 00:00:46,02
So let's talk about the phases

16
00:00:46,02 --> 00:00:48,01
of waterfall project management.

17
00:00:48,01 --> 00:00:50,02
There are five of them.

18
00:00:50,02 --> 00:00:54,07
They are initiating, planning, executing,

19
00:00:54,07 --> 00:00:58,08
monitoring and controlling and, finally, closing.

20
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:02,06
We are going to look at each one of these in more detail.

21
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:05,00
Let's start with the initiating phase.

22
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:07,07
This is how you start a new project,

23
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:09,09
the team, you as a project manager,

24
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:12,07
you're granted the authority to begin.

25
00:01:12,07 --> 00:01:15,00
That means you have the authority to direct the work,

26
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:17,08
you have the authorization to spend the money.

27
00:01:17,08 --> 00:01:19,07
Usually there's a steering committee

28
00:01:19,07 --> 00:01:22,00
that authorizes you to get started.

29
00:01:22,00 --> 00:01:24,07
Once you have their approval to move forward,

30
00:01:24,07 --> 00:01:27,00
you move right into the planning phase.

31
00:01:27,00 --> 00:01:31,01
This is where you're defining your project in great detail.

32
00:01:31,01 --> 00:01:34,03
It can be requirements analysis that result

33
00:01:34,03 --> 00:01:38,09
in defined objectives and scope of what you're going to do,

34
00:01:38,09 --> 00:01:41,05
and it defines how execution will happen.

35
00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:44,06
So, in this phase, you're defining who do you need

36
00:01:44,06 --> 00:01:47,02
to do the work, how long is it going to take,

37
00:01:47,02 --> 00:01:48,09
what's the quality going to look like,

38
00:01:48,09 --> 00:01:51,00
what are the risks you're going to face,

39
00:01:51,00 --> 00:01:54,02
and you're define your communication plan,

40
00:01:54,02 --> 00:01:57,05
your cost management plan, and stakeholder management plan.

41
00:01:57,05 --> 00:02:00,08
So all of these plans are defined in this planning phase.

42
00:02:00,08 --> 00:02:05,08
As you can tell, this can be a very time consuming stage,

43
00:02:05,08 --> 00:02:07,09
because you're defining all of this

44
00:02:07,09 --> 00:02:10,02
on larger multi-million dollar projects.

45
00:02:10,02 --> 00:02:12,00
I've seen some of these planning phases

46
00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:14,04
last literally months.

47
00:02:14,04 --> 00:02:17,05
But what it does is it provides a detailed roadmap,

48
00:02:17,05 --> 00:02:20,07
everyone on the project, everyone interested in the project,

49
00:02:20,07 --> 00:02:23,03
knows everything that has to happen, when,

50
00:02:23,03 --> 00:02:26,03
and how to get the objectives you want.

51
00:02:26,03 --> 00:02:28,00
Once you've completed planning,

52
00:02:28,00 --> 00:02:29,09
you move right into execution.

53
00:02:29,09 --> 00:02:32,04
This execution phase is pretty straightforward,

54
00:02:32,04 --> 00:02:35,06
you're just following the plans that you defined.

55
00:02:35,06 --> 00:02:37,07
The work is done in this stage

56
00:02:37,07 --> 00:02:40,04
to accomplish the objectives the way you defined them.

57
00:02:40,04 --> 00:02:42,07
You're putting all of those plans,

58
00:02:42,07 --> 00:02:46,02
management, quality, stakeholder, cost plans,

59
00:02:46,02 --> 00:02:49,06
all of that goes into action in this phase.

60
00:02:49,06 --> 00:02:52,04
The next phase, monitoring and controlling,

61
00:02:52,04 --> 00:02:56,00
actually runs in parallel to execution.

62
00:02:56,00 --> 00:02:58,05
While normally you would see the waterfall

63
00:02:58,05 --> 00:03:00,07
move like this, what's actually happening

64
00:03:00,07 --> 00:03:04,00
is you can't execute without monitoring and controlling.

65
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:06,01
So those kind of run together,

66
00:03:06,01 --> 00:03:09,04
where monitoring and controlling can kind of track off.

67
00:03:09,04 --> 00:03:12,04
Here, you are tracking the work that's being done,

68
00:03:12,04 --> 00:03:14,07
you're governing the performance of the project,

69
00:03:14,07 --> 00:03:17,02
and you're doing it throughout the entire execution.



70
00:03:17,02 --> 00:03:20,02
So this encompasses status reports and everything else

71
00:03:20,02 --> 00:03:22,07
you need to do to provide visibility

72
00:03:22,07 --> 00:03:25,06
to the steering committee and stakeholders.

73
00:03:25,06 --> 00:03:28,09
This is also how you manage changes that come up,

74
00:03:28,09 --> 00:03:30,09
like if you missed a requirement

75
00:03:30,09 --> 00:03:33,07
or something changes, your resource changes,

76
00:03:33,07 --> 00:03:35,09
this is how you manage those changes.

77
00:03:35,09 --> 00:03:39,02
This is where you find your change control processes.

78
00:03:39,02 --> 00:03:41,00
Finally, when you're done executing,



79
00:03:41,00 --> 00:03:43,01
you'll move right into the closing phase.

80
00:03:43,01 --> 00:03:45,02
The closing phase is where you figure out

81
00:03:45,02 --> 00:03:48,04
how you're going to transition this project to support.

82
00:03:48,04 --> 00:03:50,04
You're also going to figure out how you're going to release

83
00:03:50,04 --> 00:03:52,01
this to your customers.

84
00:03:52,01 --> 00:03:54,06
You're going to maybe give them documentation,

85
00:03:54,06 --> 00:03:56,01
maybe you're going to train them,

86
00:03:56,01 --> 00:03:58,01
you're going to figure out exactly what they need

87
00:03:58,01 --> 00:04:00,03
to successfully use your product.

88
00:04:00,03 --> 00:04:03,00
Finally, you'll use lessons learned sessions

89
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:06,05
to get some objective reviews of how your project went.

90
00:04:06,05 --> 00:04:08,08
What could be done better, what did you learn,

91
00:04:08,08 --> 00:04:11,03
and what should future projects know

92
00:04:11,03 --> 00:04:13,05
that you learned from this one?

93
00:04:13,05 --> 00:04:15,00
And then you'll get your official sign off

94
00:04:15,00 --> 00:04:15,09
from your steering committee

95
00:04:15,09 --> 00:04:18,01
that you did what you said you were going to do,

96
00:04:18,01 --> 00:04:20,00
when and how you said you were going to do it,

97
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:21,08
and your project ends.

98
00:04:21,08 --> 00:04:24,02
As you can see, there is a lot of work

99
00:04:24,02 --> 00:04:27,05
that goes into the waterfall process lifecycle.

100
00:04:27,05 --> 00:04:30,07
Successful project managers can follow these phases

101
00:04:30,07 --> 00:04:33,03
and deliver the value that their company's need.
