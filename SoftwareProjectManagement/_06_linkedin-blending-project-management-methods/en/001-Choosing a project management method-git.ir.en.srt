00:00:00,09 --> 00:00:04,07
Many organizations are shifting their project portfolios

2
00:00:04,07 --> 00:00:06,06
to Agile frameworks.

3
00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:10,02
However, even as the transition is taking place,

4
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:12,07
traditional methods remain.

5
00:00:12,07 --> 00:00:16,00
In fact, in many cases both Agile

6
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:20,05
and traditional project methods continue to exist together.

7
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:23,09
But knowing how to do that effectively can be a challenge.

8
00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:26,04
In fact, a lot of people think

9
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:29,07
they can't even exist together at all.

10
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:33,00
However, in this course we compare Agile

11
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:35,04
and traditional project frameworks.

12
00:00:35,04 --> 00:00:39,06
We investigate the criteria you should use as you choose

13
00:00:39,06 --> 00:00:43,01
which is the right method for your project.

14
00:00:43,01 --> 00:00:45,09
We all want to be effective project leaders

15
00:00:45,09 --> 00:00:47,05
in our organizations.

16
00:00:47,05 --> 00:00:50,08
Organizational change can make that challenging.

17
00:00:50,08 --> 00:00:54,05
What we need to do is to understand the changes taking place

18
00:00:54,05 --> 00:00:56,07
and the reasons behind them.

19
00:00:56,07 --> 00:00:59,00
Hi, I'm Kelley O'Connell.

20
00:00:59,00 --> 00:01:01,02
I've been a traditional project manager,

21
00:01:01,02 --> 00:01:04,09
and am now an Agile coach and transformation strategist.

I've also been leading organizations

24
00:01:10,02 --> 00:01:13,00
